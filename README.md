# my-project

> electron-vue project, just to see how it works

Some kind of note taking tool that could be open using `ctrl+q` shortcut.

#### Planned features:
1. "Roads": writing current state of work, so that you won't forget what you've worked on last time
2. Todo: Quickly add todo tasks. They will be shown on app start. Maybe slightly modified kanban table.
3. Notes: That could probalby by part of "roads". Save source page of copied text.
4. Everything saved in human-readable `*.md`, so that data could be useful without app.
5. Math: creating variables, simple functions. Maybe even possibility to write scripts. Remidner: that was in my last angular app, didn't worked xD
6. Reminders: talking about reminders, that would also be a nice feature. `remind me to ... in 5 minutes`

Data saved in Github Gist so that I will not loose my data as many times before.

#### Tasks:
- [x] Open app using `ctrl+q`
- [ ] Interpreting commands in commandline (e.g. `v someName` creates varable)
- [ ] Save data to `*.md` file
- [ ] Todo list interface
- [ ] Creating `roads`
- [ ] Evaluating math
